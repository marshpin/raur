# Rust Arch User Repository

A very simple and lightweight AUR Helper written in Rust. 




## Features

- Sync packages


## Notice

This project is a __NOT SO HEAVY__ work in progress. The only working feature is a very basic sync command, which may still be error-prone. __MAYBE use this if you want a functioning AUR Helper.__

# Rust Arch User Repository

A very simple and lightweight AUR Helper written in Rust. 




## Features

- Sync packages




## Notice

This project is a HEAVY work in progress. The only working feature is a very basic sync command, which may still be error prone. Do NOT use this if you want a functioning AUR Helper.

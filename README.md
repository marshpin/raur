# Rust Arch User Repository

A very simple and lightweight AUR Helper written in Rust. 




## Features

- Sync packages
- Remove packages



## Notice

This project is a __HEAVY__ work in progress. The only working feature is a very basic sync command, which may still be error-prone. __Do NOT use this if you want a functioning AUR Helper.__
